# Chocboarder
Chocboarder is (will be) a program for creating storyboards and animatics.
<br>All project code is written in C++.
<br>It's not done yet.

## Dependencies
* wxWidgets GUI
* SDL Graphics (not yet, but most likely)

wxWidgets is linked externally through CMake, so if it's not building properly the FindwxWidgets.cmake file in the CMake shared directory should be changed to accommodate your wxWidgets installation directory.
